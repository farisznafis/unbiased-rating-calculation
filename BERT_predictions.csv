But on top of this it shows you how many heart points you've earnt, how far you've walked and creates a map of your route to share on social media. Works even better when paired with a fitness watch, logging your steps, heart rete etc when you're away from your phone.",5.0,5
"It meets all my needs for a fitness app. I especially love the Strength Training mode, which automatically tracks your excercises without you having to manually enter them. I also like the concept of ""Heart Points"" and the slick and awfully familiar design of the rings, that indicate Heart Points and steps. I never really got why people hate Google Fit so much.

"I am honestly really disappointing in Google Drive. I got the new ""Google Membership"" because it had a year trial on it due to me ordering a Chromebook. That was cool and honestly wasn't all that bad. So i wanted to switch from Onedrive to Google Drive because I am already into google and I am google member because I also pay for other Google things. And honestly its just disappointing and there were little to no functionalities what so ever. For example if I want to backup my pictures onto my mobile devices then it will show up on my windows 10 computer in the file explorer, Google Drive does not have that option. Another example is that when you delete something from your mobile device from YOUR computer it should delete it on the computer, right? Wrong. It doesn't do anything to get rid of it from the computer. If you wish to have a reliable cloud service then pick Onedrive because it honestly seems like a 10x better pick.

"Google play services is an awful, awful piece of intrusive and horrible software (I'd even call it malware due to the fact that it cannot be removed, nor can it be ""disabled"" like many other pieces of google bloatware that come with android). I've gone to great lengths to limit it (removing permissions, disabling access to WiFi and data). However, recently it has been further integrated into the functions of android, meaning that the system and many apps will not function properly if you do not give google play services (and by extension Google Inc. and Alphabet) access to your data. Examples of apps that will cease to function if permissions are restricted are Google Play and Gmail. Due to this, I've had to write my negative review about google play services via my PC. I shall have to seek alternatives to android, maybe open source or windows devices. Lastly, I should note that the text and images in the app description here are misleading. You can not uninstall google play services and the options that according to the image seem to be available (force stop, uninstall) are greyed out. I'd wager you have to either root your device, or remove android entirely to get rid of google play services from your device.",1.0,1

"Practically speaking it's somewhat limited voice control, which I could do 15+ years ago on my Ericsson phone, albeit the phone had fewer functions back then. It was infinitely more useful when it was Google Now: proactive alerts telling me when I needed to leave for appointments, based on real-time traffic conditions, notifications when there was an issue with my commute. If it's meant to be an assistant let it actively assist me, not be something I have to check manually in the hope that what I need *might* be in some feed somewhere. If I have to go searching for it I may as well just open the relevant app and check there instead. It's also crying out for a name. Something pleasant to say rather than that awkward, guttural K-G-G combo. I'm certain Cortana (RIP) and Alexa were so-named at least in part because it was pleasant to say. Or better still you could let us choose the wake word (and a few more options for its voice, pretty please?) I can't be the only one who wants to call out ""Centurion"" and hear the dulcet tones of a 70s Cylon reply ""by your command"". If it actively assisted and was cool and fun to use, it'd be amazing, just now you might as well just call it ""phone functions voice control"" and give up pretending it's much else.",3.0,3

Local law enforcement-sponsored stalkers have wiped most if not all of the Drive contents of various of my Google accounts with no legal authorization I've no doubt that with Google's help my corrupt stalkers can be held accountable for their criminal unauthorized account access & file deletions but for reasons unknown - none justifiable - Google refuses to respond to my many complaints and my requests that Google enforce its TOS.,3.0,3

Not the best app out there but not the worst either. you have to open call history separately and you can't freely use call recording functions without notifying the other party. Also when we use recents tap to call a contact it will either call default set number or first added number and not the call received number which will always a bother when you want to call the same exact number called me. Instead it calls old number or my friend's parents number saved in the same contact.So change it.,3.0,3

Unfortunately there are no other options for syncing data to Stridekick for fitness challenges with the type of smartwatch and phone that I have. I wish they had customer service to help.,1.0,1
The new groups function removes the ability to quickly navigate between various tabs in a new system that makes it near impossible to identify where your different tabs are once you have any more than one group.

But when I run them manually, I have to babysit the updates and keep the screen from going to sleep. As soon as the screen goes dark, the updates stop. Its highly infuriating, especially when I get updates every 2-3 days. I feel like I spend more time maintaining my phone than using it. Searching for apps is also a pain.

I've been using this app for a while and it's become more and more frustrating. I can't use the clipboard. I can't use spellchecker. I can't use predictive typing. I don't care about dark mode.

The way they had the app set up was great then they changed it. And now instead of being able to just open your history and bookmarks from the main page you have to open a new tab to do so which slows browsing down ridiculously. They also changed the way tabs are displayed so instead of having one nice line to be able to look through there are 2 which again slows everything down when looking for a specific tab. Over all user experience is significantly lessed with this update.,2.0,2

Well now I think WhatsApp just cuz google is shutting hangouts down. This is bull and meat is trash. I have skyphone but cheap phones will not ring. And you can use it on tablet pc so will WhatsApp but as long you have a cell your ok. All my calls are overseas. If I call from phone I will not have money left. Some can't call some countries. If someone knows what's good send me message in Twitter at @freebird4566z and we can chat. Maybe find something else that works. We all need something to use,1.0,1

It's quite basic.

My reason for giving three stars is because of the cloud based and accessibility otherwise it's missing to much but for me what I've listed is the major issue.,3.0,3
For a free app it's ok. As others have pointed out it's not that accurate as a step counter and it doesn't always track movement that accurately getting start and end points wrong.

"I just bought a new cell phone, and realized that this app creates a totally new work profile. In the work profile you will find duplicated apps which are linked to your Gsuit, so they could remotely access/erase just the work related data, and not your whole phone in case they fire you. It's actually a good idea, but the problem is that it severely limits the functionality of the whole work profile apps. For example, it's difficult (or just impossible) to attach a document created in your personal profile into your work Gmail or Google Drive. It's not possible to work on your Google Forms either, since the work profile doesn't create a copy of Chrome or the default browser. You should include the option to integrate apps into the work profile! Thank you!",2.0,2

The app needs some improvements. 1. The widget doesn't show the current step count. You need to tap it to go inside the app and then it shows the latest step count.

"It really sucks because i really dont like working in the app! I liked it better when i stayed in Chrome. The bar was much easier to navigate and overall, easier to use in chrome. The app is very confusing and some things are missing such as scribble. This is very frustating considering the fact that there is no way to change it back! Is there any way to stop it from going to the app and stay in chrome?",2.0,1
The application is good and useful but something is missing which is ability to see block messages. If a phone number is block and the messages is also block there's suppose to be a message displayed contents.,3.0,3
Nice smooth app .it has all the functionality i need .My only only complaint is the lack luster ui.If the developers create a much more creative ui then i would give this 5 stars.,4.0,4
"I've loved this app for years. Now everytime I open Chrome, a tab isn't loading. So i go to see all the tabs to close it out, nothing shows. So i hot it again, and the screen goes grey, making me have to close out entirely. I know you don't care about what your consumers love, but can you just fix this simple problem. I've cleared everything, uninstalled updates, the whole five yards.",2.0,1

Why can't I accept calls without unlocking my screen? It's frustrating. It doesn't even appear on my screen. The phone is ringing but my phone screen shows nothing.

"This app used to be very very good. Sending and receiving money was effortless. Now I have to feel sorry for and cry for anybody who receives money from me.

I used to like this app because all my transactions were private, Unlike some other money transferring apps. Stay away from this app. Google I'm disappointed.",1.0,1

This app is horrendous. Very disappointing that it came from Google. There are so many bugs and so many basic features that isn't implemented.

I'm not sure if there's an issue with the security or what is causing the glitch but it's incredibly frustrating. I would not recommend this. Unfortunately there are no other options for syncing data to Stridekick for fitness challenges with the type of smartwatch and phone that I have. I wish they had customer service to help.,1.0,1

When making decorative docs, it can really interrupt an aesthetic, and it ends up ruining the whole thing. - - - - Customized backgrounds. Being able to upload images as backgrounds instead of flat colors would be lovely! Specifically tables. I used tables a bunch, and it would be nice to add a nice polka dot pattern to them. - - - - Customized borders. Again, another addition that would be appreciated by anyone who likes making their docs pretty. A nice flower border or something similar would be just wonderful~ - - - - Gradients / shadows / etc for text. Just like in slides! - - - - Customized fonts / the ability to add your own fonts.",3.0,4

"I restarted using the app since last week. It was ok for 1or 2 days. Later I find steps data is not getting stored. After walking in the morning it shows u have walked 5k steps and awards heart points of 20-30. But when I again walk in the evening, morning walk data gets different to 1700 or 300 like that and heart points disappear. Duration of walk is retained but steps, heart points data gets differently, far lower.Alternatively, it retains morning data and alters evening data.I don't know how",2.0,2

If Google could develop an application to link or connect Wi-Fi (or Bluetooth compatible) only tablets to their cell phone, it would be awesome. If you have something like this already, I would love the feedback so I can find it. I like the idea of sticking with one developer that allows their programs to ""communicate"" with other devices on the same account. That way there is no difference what device you're on, they will look the same without having to remember how each operates to do the same thing.

Great app! I have truly fallen in love with the G Suite/Google Workspace apps. Far faster and more proficient than any of its competitors.

This is a fairly decent pedometer but doesn't really capture the activity you are performing. I do 60 minutes of cardio in the gym and rarely get above 20 heart points. I get more points walking 3/4 miles to the gym than actual workouts in the gym. Not sure how this app calculates activity but it's only accurate when distance is involved.

"I mean, don't get me wrong, it does (kinda) what it's supposed to, but since about a month/month and a half ago the app does not measure my steps correctly, when running (gets around 40% of 'em) so it, probably because of this, does not give me any heart points even for 11km run. No biggie, but I kinda enjoyed the score system, as it kept me motivated, isn't there any better way to determine heart points, instead of the steps?

I wish it was more customizable. Like change colors to match your phone theme also event colors. Even if it had its own custom style designs. I get tired of the blue and white.

The alarm volume turns itself down. I have had Google phones for years and thought this was user error despite never touching the alarm volume but it seems to be a widespread problem after discovering other people complain about this online.

"Great alarm clock, no ads & easier to set than my phone's factory clock. The only thing I don't like is the alarm snooze, which requires swiping in one direction for snooze or other direction to cancel - too easy to get it wrong & accidentally cancel when you were trying to snooze! Tap to snooze, swipe to cancel is more logical when you've just been awoken. All others I've tried do it that way, for good reason.",5.0,4

"Today for the second time since I got my phone with this as the default clock app, I woke up to an alarm that couldn't be dismissed because it never gave me the option to dismiss it.

"I use this app every day and I love it, but it seems to me that Google has kinda pushed it to the side. All the other 'Play' apps have moved on, such as Play Music and Play Movies Barring that, it's pretty great to use, I just which it had these 4 features: 1. Ability to edit metadata (Title, author, cover) 2. Custom shelves in the app, or some other way to manually organise your library 3. Ability to add your own uploaded mp3 audiobooks 4. Ability to add custom series' from uploaded books.",3.0,4

The app is detecting the calls while I receive them. In India it still has to mark a lot of numbers as spam or invalid etc. Major set back for me is the search functionality. It doesn't search the notes field and many other fields for any search argument. I maintain a lot of notes regarding each contact and for me to have a contextual search I have to go back to the native phone app. Though I'm fan of many Google apps and also a Gsuite user but this app has failed me in many terms.,1.0,2

I have enjoyed using the app over the years as it has made picking up the hobby of reading easier. Any down time I have I can just grab my phone and enjoy a book. I do wish the note taking portion was improved some though. When highlighting its hard to tell where your stopping at as your finger is over the words. This could be resolved by showing a magnified snippet of what you are highlighting above your finger. Just a thought,3.0,4

"There are some tweaks that would make this app excellent: (1) the ability to replicate an entry. Right now it is easier for me to just edit an existing entry to update it to another date/time, but then I lose the history of appointments. So if I could tap 'replicate' and put in the new date and time I could keep all the details (and not have to re-input them). Much more efficient. (2) If I could color code the entry so that I can prioritize tasks/appointments, or even mark them as completed. (3) I would like to be able to set an alarm with certain tasks/appointments. Sometimes I miss the notification 'beep' - an alarm would be much more audible.",4.0,4

"I just bought a new cell phone, and realized that this app creates a totally new work profile. In the work profile you will find duplicated apps which are linked to your Gsuit, so they could remotely access/erase just the work related data, and not your whole phone in case they fire you. It's actually a good idea, but the problem is that it severely limits the functionality of the whole work profile apps. For example, it's difficult (or just impossible) to attach a document created in your personal profile into your work Gmail or Google Drive. It's not possible to work on your Google Forms either, since the work profile doesn't create a copy of Chrome or the default browser.

The whole point of me download this app was so that I can be able to screen calls on my Samsung note 10. So the fact that I am unable to do so puts me off of this app all together. I was so happy to find out that this app was available for another device other than a pixel device when I downloaded it at 1st but when I was unable to screen calls That excitement quickly went away. If they change this so will my review.....,2.0,1

"Have seen a slow regression with this app. It seems like developers have been focusing more on Google Chat which is supposed to replace Hangouts at some point.

Great & Nice App!!!,5.0,5
This app runs great for me and has completely eliminated unwanted phone calls from telemarketers and scammers. I haven't had to talk to a single one since setting it up. I also love that it automatically declines calls from numbers that I and others have previously maked as spam. This prevents them from waisting even a second of my time. Excellent app!!,5.0,5
I cant even update it on google play and this has been a reoccuring issue from previous updates the solution then was to factory reset the update everything.,1.0,1

We don't want to create scheduled workouts, we want to workout randomly when we feel like it and just have it recorded on calendar. Too much work, hassle, and assumptions by Google.",1.0,2

Unlike Apple Wallet that connects to each individual app which results in showing relevant data with the wallet app itself such as loyalty card balance etc. Google pay is more like another 3rd party wallet app with the ability to use your CC that's all.

"Hangouts used to be the best possible alternative to iMessage. It supported conversations on phone, tablet, or computer, with continuity across all devices. The recent updates to Android (specifically the forced and very bad changes to the way that notifications are categorized) has removed a key feature from the app. Now you can no longer use a customized sound per person for your discussion. Only one sound can be selected for the whole app, which means you can't tell who is messaging you by the sound any more. This whole change is very problematic. In Messages, now I can't make group conversations silent. The notifications always show up no matter what I change. Since there is no way to leave a group SMS conversation, I am stuck in chats with people that I can't make silent. That was frustrating enough, but now Hangouts has adopted the same system. I suspect that Google is just slowly making Hangouts worse and worse so that people will stop using it and they can quietly cancel it next year without an complaints. Now, every notification on the phone has the same sound. I can't customize the sounds for individual applications anymore. This is really a step in the wrong direction.",2.0,2

"The new update has gone out of its way to make it more difficult to keep track of information in tabs with how it handles grouping. If you could effectively merge groups of tabs together, without having to remove tabs from a group piecemeal, or didn't default to making a new group when wanting to make a new tab, this frustration would be lessened. In addition, the apperent issue with other people updating is disheartening. Will likely look for a new browser for the next while.",2.0,2

"Dear Sir, I have been using google phone app for 2 years and have seen a lot of updates till date.

Iphone's Call App, The way call button slides towards right for receiving calls and specially call waiting feature (That is one of the most amazing and preferred amongst callers) which consists 3 Buttons i.e. Hold and Accept/End and Accept or Decline.  I think if you feel okay then you can apply the same or just to its interface to your own app. Also I have attached a few reference pic for Iphone's call app Thanking You, Yours True Call User Mintu Kumar INDIA",5.0,4

"Mixed opinions. Pro: can run multiple concurrent timers, which is useful when multitasking (dishwasher done in 1:40, washing machine in 0:45, etc). Downside: the Alarms all use the same volume and snooze duration. I want a different volume for my morning alarm clock and pill reminder alarms. Likewise, I need a short Snooze on my morning alarm, and a longer snooze on my pill reminders. The factory OEM alarm on my old LG XPower did that, and it was amazing.",4.0,3

Why does it not display the year? Should allow you to change date format. Should be able to snooze in advance along with the dismiss option.
