Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!

It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Google Fit will also help you:

TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH

Get instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.

MONITOR YOUR GOALS

See your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.

MAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT

If you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.

CONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES

Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.

CHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE

See a snapshot of your activity history across Fit and your integrated apps in the redesigned journal.

Google Family Link for parents,"Try the free Family Link parental controls app from Google. Whether your children are younger or in their teens, the Family Link app lets you set digital ground rules remotely from your own device to help guide them as they learn, play, and explore online. For children under 13 (or the <a href=""https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?p=families_aoc"">applicable age of consent in your country</a>), Family Link also lets you create a Google Account for your child that's like your account, with access to most Google services.


  With Family Link parental controls, you can:

 <b>Guide them to good content</b>

 • View their app activity - Not all screen time is the same. Help your child make healthy decisions about what they do on their Android device, with activity reports showing how much time they’re spending on their favorite apps. You can see daily, weekly, or monthly reports.
 • Manage their apps - Handy notifications let you approve or block apps your child wants to download from the Google Play Store. You can also manage in-app purchases, and hide specific apps on their device, all remotely from your own device.
 • Feed their curiosity - It can be hard to figure out what apps are right for your child, so Family Link shows you teacher-recommended apps on Android that you can add directly to their device.


  <b>Keep an eye on screen time</b>

  • Set limits - It’s up to you to decide the right amount of screen time for your child. Family Link lets you set time limits and a bedtime for their supervised devices, so you can help them find a good balance.
  • Lock their device - Whether it’s time to go play outside, have dinner, or just spend time together, you can remotely lock a supervised device whenever it’s time to take a break.


  <b>See where they are</b>

  • It’s helpful to be able to find your child when they’re on the go. You can use Family Link to help locate them as long as they’re carrying their Android devices.


  <b>Important Information</b>

  • Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at families.google.com/familylink/setup
  • While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.
 • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps.
 • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, it must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet.
 • Teacher-recommended apps are only available on Android devices in the US to parents of children of certain ages.
 • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience, it does not make the internet safe. Rather, it is intended to give parents choices about how their kids use the internet, and encourage conversations about internet use.","Try the free Family Link parental controls app from Google.

You can also manage in-app purchases, and hide specific apps on their device, all remotely from your own device.<br> • Feed their curiosity - It can be hard to figure out what apps are right for your child, so Family Link shows you teacher-recommended apps on Android that you can add directly to their device.<br><br><br>  <b>Keep an eye on screen time</b><br><br>  • Set limits - It’s up to you to decide the right amount of screen time for your child. Family Link lets you set time limits and a bedtime for their supervised devices, so you can help them find a good balance.<br>  • Lock their device - Whether it’s time to go play outside, have dinner, or just spend time together, you can remotely lock a supervised device whenever it’s time to take a break.<br><br><br>  <b>See where they are</b><br><br>  • It’s helpful to be able to find your child when they’re on the go. You can use Family Link to help locate them as long as they’re carrying their Android devices.<br><br><br>  <b>Important Information</b><br><br>  • Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at families.google.com/familylink/setup<br>  • While Family Link helps you manage your child&#39;s purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.<br> • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps.<br> • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, it must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet.<br> • Teacher-recommended apps are only available on Android devices in the US to parents of children of certain ages.<br> • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience, it does not make the internet safe. Rather, it is intended to give parents choices about how their kids use the internet, and encourage conversations about internet use.","Set screen time limits, manage apps, and view app activity for your kids device.","Set screen time limits, manage apps, and view app activity for your kids device.","10,000,000+",10000000,4.0925617,727552,289465,"[119490, 7019, 22939, 115312, 462792]",0,True,USD,False,,,,False,,Varies with device,Varies,Varies with device,Google LLC,5700313618786177705,familylink-support@google.com,https://families.google.com/familylink,"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043",https://www.google.com/policies/privacy,5700313618786177705,Tools,TOOLS,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rFAHXzQjUQwLH6vffa9rD_1gjH7dZykH7h6RjthsnoHTKGrJSNqTUw0D_TIQSC3ekg,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n7_pSwDQW8Qd51O2zrTyn0VJ8DNXNwG3grITTzgcp7SrwL46EUQLz3RNO6QYvsJ1hbk,"['https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6ZaOAJFqmz3AzsOEyWTa_ul0bXrf-DgnehC6YQOpDmeneIXMjXUhONqI-074n1Z3NQ', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3aAU7bOII9KE9leNiIJYnsAzqi9crtt59xMM3oRZhLF435rg22iWv7HnTi7Erx_Nk8kb', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rSL-5Zq6xSjpWDnKHgSFE81Y2YGVkXG91Ph-DZNnOncDXHuyf7J1HK_ZCxIZd4osUDtJ', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7ELCx9B5418iOjH4qtHFqAyfeq0w-De_4BtuZmX3eYdnsq1RWp-YTPXrDrW0NCQZ8Q', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/h09C-oRaO1OZpIOphxIb1fpLG0wLp275oWjYOjjxvExAcI29mXKf-E3er37-VtLHhzvo', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n41vvMifwXtt3sKfv08YubaDO554a3QZzhz2R0DyqZ3NqL2QLNLMGqo1nhBYNq89_OM', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rSV-ymzrhI2eY-R3ewLAyufoSno9cH5K9n6fXwjYvIpBSzYK38hXt-fpHD7C1amVtg']",,,Everyone,,,False,"Mar 15, 2017",1611691274,1.71.0.Z.350181002,Several stability improvements and bug fixes.,Several stability improvements and bug fixes.,False,com.google.android.apps.kids.familylink,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylink&hl=en&gl=us

YouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment that makes it simpler and more fun for them to explore on their own, and easier for parents and caregivers to guide their journey as they discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids

<b>A safer online experience for kids</b>
We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.

<b>Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls</b>
<b>Limit screen time:</b> Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.
<b>Keep up with what they watch:</b> Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.
<b>Blocking:</b> Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again. 
<b>Flagging:</b> You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

<b>Create individual experiences as unique as your kids</b>
Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from ""Approved Content Only"" mode or select an age category that fits your child, ""Preschool"", ""Younger"", or ""Older"". 

Select the ""Approved Content Only"" mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos.The ""Preschool"" Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The ""Younger"" Mode allows kids 5-7 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our ""Older"" Mode gives kids 8 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids. 

<b>All kinds of videos for all kinds of kids </b>
Our library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between. 

<b>Other important information:</b>

  <b>Guide them to good content</b>

  • View app their activity - Not all screen time is the same. Help your child make healthy decisions about what they do on their Android device, with activity reports showing how much time they’re spending on their favorite apps. You can see daily, weekly, or monthly reports.
  • Manage their apps - Handy notifications let you approve or block apps your child wants to download from the Google Play Store. You can also manage in-app purchases, and hide specific apps on their device all remotely from your own device.
  • Feed their curiosity - It can be hard to figure out what apps are right for your child, so Family Link shows you teacher-recommended apps on Android that you can add directly to their device.


  <b>Keep an eye on screen time</b>

  • Set limits - It’s up to you to decide the right amount of screen time for your child. Family Link lets you set time limits and a bedtime for their supervised devices, so you can help them find a good balance.

  • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps.
  • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, it must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet.
  • Teacher-recommended apps are only available on Android devices in the US to parents of children of certain ages.
